# Copilot Fundamentals Training Exercises

## Introduction

### :warning: Note: The primary objective of this demo Repository is not to complete all the exercises. If you don't achieve the exact results by the end, that's perfectly fine! What matters most is that you gain insight into how to use Copilot effectively.

## Overview

Our goal is to **acquaint you with Copilot's functionalities** and demonstrate diverse ways to interact effectively with Copilot.

Copilot and Copilot Chat, while built on the same backend technology, serve distinct roles within your integrated development environment (IDE). To put it simply, **Copilot functions as a coding assistant**, responding to your in-code context, while **Copilot Chat operates as your research assistant**, enabling chat-based communication for more interactive collaboration with Copilot.

As these exercises leverage Copilot for code suggestions, please note that Copilot's responses may vary depending on the context. We welcome this variability, as it showcases the dynamic capabilities of Copilot.

For effective interaction with Copilot, it's essential to keep in mind that **Copilot benefits from your guidance and supervision!**
 
 To use copilot's own words,
